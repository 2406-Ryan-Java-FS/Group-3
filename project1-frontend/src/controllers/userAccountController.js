    Attemping to use controllers on the frontend.
    These can manage state/data.
    These can hold functions which can be called from React OR qunit for testing.

    Attempting to make the app testable.
    React side will go through menus/pages/modals and 
    make things look pretty,  but I would like it to be 
    as dumb as possible so we aren't tangled in state management hell.
